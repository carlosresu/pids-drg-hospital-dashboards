    "1. **Optionally authenticate** with `gcloud` (via user prompt).  \n",

    "3. **(Optional) Save** these names to a local CSV for debugging.  \n",
    "4. **Launch Selenium** (using `a_source_chrome_webdriver.py`) to open Power BI in **headless** mode,  \n",
    "   select each facility in the slicer, and **export** a PDF to `./hospital-reports`.\n"
